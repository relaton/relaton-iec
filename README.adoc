Iecbib is a Ruby gem that implements the https://github.com/riboseinc/isodoc-models#iso-bibliographic-item[IsoBibliographicItem model].

You can use it to retrieve metadata of IEC Standards from https://www.iec.ch, and access such metadata through the `IsoBibliographicItem` object.

== Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

[source,ruby]
----
gem 'iecbib'
----

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install iecbib

== Usage

Refer to https://github.com/riboseinc/isobib/blob/master/README.adoc: the usage interface is identical.

== Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).


== Exceptional Citations

This gem retrieves bibliographic descriptions of ISO documents by doing searches on the ISO website, http://www.iso.org, and screenscraping the document that matches the queried document identifier. The following documents are not returned as search results from the ISO website, and the gem returns manually generated references to them.

* `IEV`: used in the metanorma-iso gem to reference Electropedia entries generically. Is resolved to an "all parts" reference to IEC 60050, which in turn is resolved into the specific documents cited by their top-level clause.

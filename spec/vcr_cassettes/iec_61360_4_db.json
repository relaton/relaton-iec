In addition, the dictionaries of concepts may be used as\n    reference collections for setting up master data repositories for product data that serve as company internal information backbones.\n    Thus, costly interpretation and conversion errors may be minimized.\n\n    From the market side, pressure is increasingly being exerted to supply product data in electronic form using commonly agreed concepts\n    and as this pressure grows, it will have a considerable impact on all business processes. For this reason, a seamless exchange of\n    product data, i.e., an exchange that is free from media discontinuities requires a unified, joint approach both for exchanging product\n    data internally within a company or for exchanging product data with suppliers or customers.\n  language:\n  - en\n  script:\n  - Latn\n  format: text/plain"
